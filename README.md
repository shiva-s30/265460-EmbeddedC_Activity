# Embedded C Activity - Temperature Controller 
The project is about designing a temperature controller for the seat of a car using a Atmega328 Microcontroller that contains the following modules
- Button Sensor to check if person is seated or not
- Temperature Sensor to measure the temperature of the seat
- Heater to check if the heater is turned ON/OFF
- Led Actuator to verify if the person has seated and heater has been turned ON
- Display CDD to provide the value of temperature using a ADC by showing a PWM
- Send and receive the temperature value using UART
