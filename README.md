# Temperature Controller 
The project is about designing a temperature controller for the seat of a car using a Atmega328 Microcontroller that contains the following modules
  -   Button Sensor to check if person is seated or not
  -   Temperature Sensor to measure the temperature of the seat
  -   Heater to check if the heater is turned ON/OFF
  -   Led Actuator to verify if the person has seated and heater has been turned ON
  -   Display CDD to provide the value of temperature by showing a PWM
  -   Heat Controller module (Atmega328 Microcontroller)
